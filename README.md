## Hats microservice

<!-- Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.-->

I have a fully functioning Hat model that has been integrated into my react frontend utilizing GET PUT DELTE & POST api functions in my views.py file 
On the front end I have a hat list page which routes the hat models in my db to my react app.js and i have a create a hat nav link which allows the user to create a hat.

I have yet to utilize polling and there is no interaction with the location resources as of yet.
