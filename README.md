## Hats microservice

<!-- Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe

My hat model takes in a few CharFields and URLField based off a model.Models import 
they come as of now with a GET and PUT api call that can create a hat, view all hats, or show specific details of a specific hat by ID.
It does not integrate with the wardrobe microservice at the moment.
